**Introduction**

This SQL project involves creating tables for Customers, Products, and Orders, inserting data, 
and executing various SQL queries for data exploration, preparation, analysis, and visualization. 
The project aims to derive insights from the dataset related to customer demographics, product 
sales, and revenue analysis.

**Data Exploration**

I began by exploring the structure and content of the dataset tables using the DESCRIBE command 
to understand the columns and data types. Additionally, I viewed the first few rows of each 
table to get an initial overview of the data distribution.

**Data Preparation**

Data preparation involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data 
consistency. I checked for missing values, anomalies, and duplicates in the dataset tables to 
ensure data quality for subsequent analysis.

**Analysis**

In the analysis phase, I calculated the total revenue generated from orders, analyzed customer 
demographics to determine the average age and total number of customers, and identified the 
top-selling products based on total sales quantity.

**SQL Queries**

I used SQL queries to answer key business questions, such as calculating the total revenue 
generated by each product, determining the number of orders placed by each customer, and 
finding the average order value for each product category.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the project revealed significant insights, including the total revenue generated, 
average customer age, top-selling products, and monthly sales trends. Recommendations for 
business improvement were also provided, such as targeting marketing efforts towards top-selling
products and analyzing customer demographics for tailored campaigns.
